    Registers named structured op matcher callbacks specific for IREE to use
    with `transform.iree.match_callback`. This should be called before first
    `match_callback` may be executed following the transform dialect control
    flow.

    The callbacks must have a unique name and a signature compatible with
    `MatchCallbacksRegistry::MatchCallbackFn`, which currently means
    `DiagnosedSilenceableFailure(MatchCallbackResult &, Location,
     const TransformState &, ValueRange)`. The callback receives a "result",
     followed by a location at which errors should be reported, a transform
     state at the moment of the _match_ (not registration) and a list of
     handle values passed as operands to the `match_callback` operation.
     It is expected to populate the "result" object with lists of payload
     operations that will be bound to the handles produced by the
     `match_callback` operation. The callback may fail, at which point
     it should produce a silenceable error. The callback currently is not
     allowed to modify the payload IR (though this may be revised in the
     future for the purpose of communicating the properties of the IR
     captured by the match). Therefore, it should not have a reason to
     produce a definite error.

    Performs payload IR matching using a C++ callback registered beforehand.
    The callback is identified by name and is passed the current transform
    state and the list of handle operands, along with information necessary
    for error propagation. See `register_match_callbacks` for the description
    of the callback contract.

    If `failure_propagation_mode` is set to `suppress`, any silenceable errors
    in the callback (typically, "failure to match") will be ignored and the
    resulting handles will be associated with empty lists of payload
    operations. Otherwise, silenceable failures are propagated.
