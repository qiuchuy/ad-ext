# Call #0 of @mul.
# API: iree_vm_invoke
type: call
function: module.mul
args:
# arg[0]: the first `--input=` buffer. !input.get would retain the input for
# other calls to use but otherwise prefer taking ownership.
- !input.take 0
# arg[1]: constant value defined inline.
- !hal.buffer_view 4xf32=0,1,2,3
results:
# result[0]: store in blackboard slot 4 for later use.
- !blackboard.set 4

# Assigns one or more source values to a set of target values.

from:
# from[0]: retain blackboard slot 4, leaving it for later use.

to:
