# Building from source

!!! info ""

    While IREE does offer
    [binary distributions](https://github.com/openxla/iree/releases) for its
    compiler tools and [Python bindings](../reference/bindings/python.md), building from
    source is still useful when using IREE's runtime or when making changes to the
    compiler or import tools themselves.
