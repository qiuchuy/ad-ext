# IREE Reduce Sample

This sample demonstrates the usage of `iree-reduce`, a test case reducer. To
use this sample, `iree-reduce` and `iree-compile` should have been built
already.

The sample can be ran by:

```
iree-reduce test/interesting.py test/reduce.mlir
```

Getting these samples into the CI is being worked on.
