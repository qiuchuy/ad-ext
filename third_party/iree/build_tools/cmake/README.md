# IREE-specific cmake functions

The functions in this directory are intended to be used within the IREE project.
Using them outside IREE is ***entirely*** unsupported. IREE team reserves the
right to break the out-of-tree usage at any time without notice, and will do so
if it becomes more invasive or adds complexity to the project. Relying on these
functions may be convenient for downstream projects, but they are doing so at
their own risk.
