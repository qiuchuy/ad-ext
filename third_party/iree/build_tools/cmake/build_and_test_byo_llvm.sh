# Note: by using the `build_llvm` action here, we are exercising byo_llvm.sh's
# ability to build LLVM... from our own third_party/llvm-project. That's not
# the most intuitive interpretation of "bring your own LLVM", since as far as
# the source repository is concerned, that's just the standard IREE-bundled one,
# but that exists for good reasons as some users need control more over the
# building and packaging than over the source repository, and that's good to
# have test coverage for, and of course that's more convenient for us to test.
