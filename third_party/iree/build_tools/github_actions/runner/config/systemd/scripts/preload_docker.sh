# Pre-fetches docker images so we don't have to wait for docker to fetch them as
# part of `docker run` in the CI jobs. This isn't comprehensive but pre-fetches
# things we think are pretty likely to be useful to pre-fetch. It runs in the
# background so shouldn't have a significant impact on other startup tasks. It
# also won't block fetches being done by the job itself. It could compete for
# network bandwidth though, so we don't want to just always try to fetch
# everything.
