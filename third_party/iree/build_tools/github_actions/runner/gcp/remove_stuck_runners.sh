# Due to limitations in MIGs, we quite frequently want to manually bring down
# instances that aren't currently running a job. This script automates that.
# Note that there is totally the potential for a race here: we could identify
# the runner as idle and it could pick up a job before its deletion causes it to
# deregister on shutdown. This is also a (bigger) problem with the manual
# removal that this script automates.
